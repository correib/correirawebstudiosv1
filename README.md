Currently hosted on: https://correib.github.io/correirawebstudiosv1/ prior to moving to dedicated domain name.
Web development project, public facing personal website. Most of my time and effort goes into
the work that I do for my employers as I enjoy building for customers, but I need to have something
for myself!

# Description
This project is designed as a one page personal website for introduction, experience summary,
resume/skill information, and contact details. Will be continuously rounding out the edges as time permits.

# 01/05/23 Update
Moving on to adding more CSS concepts to improve the UI.

# 02/02/23-02/06/23 Update
Looking to further improve the UI (adding some bootstrap components). 
Including custom icon and personal photo now as well. Still need to 
add mobile responsiveness and finish adding more personal information.
Also need to update my resume for 2023.

# correirawebstudiosv1
Web development project, public facing personal website. Most of my time and effort goes into
the work that I do for my employers as I enjoy building for customers, but I need to have something
for myself!

# Description
This project is designed as a one page personal website for introduction, experience summary,
resume/skill information, and contact details. Will be continuously rounding out the edges as time permits.

# 01/05/23 Update
Moving on to adding more intermediate CSS concepts to improve the UI.

# 02/02/23 Update
Looking to further improve the UI (adding some bootstrap components),
and make jumping through the page possible. Including custom icon and 
personal photo now as well.
